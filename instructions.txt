Review Management App Requirements Document
Overview
This web application is designed to help businesses collect customer reviews and manage their online reputation. The app generates unique short URLs and QR codes for businesses, which customers can use to leave ratings and reviews. Depending on the rating, customers are either asked for feedback or directed to leave reviews on popular platforms like Google Maps, Facebook, or Yelp.
